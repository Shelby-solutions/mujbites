## Current Task: Codebase Exploration
Exploring the structure and contents of the MujBites app codebase

Plan:
[X] Explore Flutter app structure (lib directory)
  [X] Main app configuration and setup
    - Flutter app using Material Design 3
    - Firebase integration for messaging and notifications
    - Provider for state management
    - Multiple screens: login, signup, home, profile, orders, restaurant panel
    - Custom theme implementation
    - Local storage with shared_preferences and sqflite
    - Background message handling for notifications
  [X] Models
    - order.dart: Order and OrderItem models with JSON serialization
    - cart.dart: Shopping cart implementation
    - notification_model.dart: Push notification handling
    - cart_item.dart: Individual cart item structure
  [X] Services
    - api_service.dart: HTTP client with error handling and timeouts
    - notification_service.dart: Push notification handling
    - user_preferences.dart: Local storage management
    - auth_service.dart: User authentication
    - gemini_service.dart: AI integration
    - order_service.dart: Order management
  [X] Utils
    - notification_rate_limiter.dart: Rate limiting for notifications
    - encryption_util.dart: Data encryption utilities
    - logger.dart: Logging functionality

[X] Explore Backend structure
  [X] Server setup and configuration
    - Express.js server with MongoDB
    - WebSocket support
    - Security middleware (helmet, cors)
    - Session management with MongoStore
    - Routes: restaurants, users, orders, cart, recommendations
    - Health monitoring endpoints
    - Graceful shutdown handling
  [X] Models
    - orders.js: Mongoose schema with auto-cancellation after 8 minutes
    - user.js: User authentication and profile
    - recommendations.js: User preferences and suggestions
    - MenuItems.js: Restaurant menu items
    - restaurantModel.js & Restaurant.js: Restaurant information
    - Cart.js: Shopping cart data structure
  [X] Services
    - firebaseService.js: Push notification handling with retry logic
    - websocketService.js: Real-time communication
  [X] Controllers
    - orderController.js: Order creation and management
    - recommendationsController.js: User recommendations
    - restaurantController.js: Restaurant management
    - userController.js: User authentication and profile management
  [X] Utils
    - logger.js: Logging functionality
    - error.js: Error handling utilities
  [X] Middleware
    - authMiddleware.js: JWT token authentication
    - isRestaurantOwner.js: Restaurant owner authorization
    - routeGuard.js: Route access control
    - validation.js: Request data validation
    - authenticateToken.js: Token verification

Key Features Identified:
1. Real-time notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging
2. Restaurant management panel
3. Cart and order management with auto-cancellation
4. User authentication and sessions
5. Recommendations system
6. WebSocket integration for real-time updates
7. AI integration through Gemini service
8. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
9. Rate limiting for notifications
10. Data encryption for sensitive information
11. Role-based access control
12. Request validation middleware

Notable Findings:
1. The app uses a dual-model approach where both client and server maintain their own data structures
2. Strong type safety in Flutter with dedicated model classes
3. Mongoose schemas with validation and middleware in the backend
4. Auto-cancellation feature for unaccepted orders after 8 minutes
5. Comprehensive error handling and data validation on both ends
6. Sophisticated notification system with token validation and retry logic
7. Environment-aware API endpoints (dev/prod) with timeout handling
8. Caching mechanisms for device tokens and user preferences
9. Parallel notification dispatch with Promise.allSettled
10. Rate limiting to prevent notification spam
11. Encryption utilities for sensitive data
12. Structured logging across both client and server
13. JWT-based authentication with role verification
14. Layered middleware for security and validation

Exploration Complete! The codebase shows a well-structured, secure, and feature-rich food delivery application with strong emphasis on real-time communication, security, and user experience.
